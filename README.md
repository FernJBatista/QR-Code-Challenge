## My process
Here I will briefly describe what my thought process was, and how I tackled this challenge.

  I decided to give the body a flex display and a flex-direction of column to make the layout vertical and visualize the elements. I then created <div class="code-container"> with containing the image, the header text, and the paragraph text to style properly as the qr code container in the image. I gave this div a flex display, and column direction as well. 
  
  When styling the container I just tried to guess the padding & margings of the elements from the image provided. Made the rounded corners and sized down <div class="code-container"> to again what I guessed is an approximate meassure.

  Lastly I sepparated <div class="attribution"> from <div class="code-container"> to give it a better look. 



### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned
In the process of making this I think I tried to focus on too many things at the same time. Maybe in my workflow I could try to organize what needs to be done first before iterating over and over without having everything properly determined.

```

### Continued development

I wasn't sure how to separate <div class="attribution"> to completely make it go to the bottom while keeping the <div class="code-container"> in the center, I would like to find a way to fix this.
